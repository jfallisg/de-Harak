# de-Harak is a theme for Pelican

This is a somewhat minimally featured theme, visually inspired by Rudolph de Harak book covers.

## INDEX page

+ Customize the header bio and header nav links in your pelican config file.
+ Rather than having the blog at INDEX, you get an actual list of PROJECTS and POSTS
+ Any page not called "about.md" gets filed as a PROJECT
+ Any post gets filed in reverse chronological sort

## Article & Pages

+ Single article without pagination
+ Same header as INDEX
+ Disqus discussion at foot

## about.md

+ Supports custom CSS, though default is broken down by:
	+ BIO
	+ RESUME
	+ ABOUT THIS PAGE
	+ ABOUT PAGE LINKS (this is an ASIDE)
+ Same header as INDEX

Feel free to fork and modify as you will!
